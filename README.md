# MY WEEK 2 PROJECT

This is my __second__ week project. And I must admit it's been a struggle all along:

-My bootstrap keeps overwriting my personal style despite the fact that it's linked __after__ my bootstrap.. This means images & divs did not responded as expected.

-The whole structure is not responding as should.

-I'm sure it's my mistake.. nevertheless I learned a lot with this one...

## Installation:
###First things first:
<br><br>

```
#headerNfo {
  background-image: url(../images/backgrounds/landing.jpg);
  background-size: 100%;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}

```
As you can see i did my best to keep the extra styling to a minimum.... **well kinna :p**

#The elements:



I feel like my code is a mumbo jumbo of divs, spans etc.. __way to messy__.

I was unable to create a carousel within the navbar...

first section contains a set of rows and collums for the hover: images. i had a problem there with padding i __could not explain__.. meh :p

I have implemented the Jquery for age verification as per our lesson but despite the fact that I have specified __ready__, the script still seems to load before the page completes.. You can tell from the header image...

My next issue was the
